                <p>Raeef Kabbani for his long-standing and deliberate refusal to pay large outstanding debts owed to his suppliers. His repeated dishonesty and broken promises have not only violated basic business ethics but have also caused immense financial hardship.</p>
                <p>Several suppliers, who once trusted him and fulfilled orders in good faith, have suffered devastating consequences. Some are struggling to survive. Others have already been forced to shut down, unable to bear the cash flow crisis caused by his refusal to pay.</p>
                <p>Raeef Kabbani’s actions are not just irresponsible—they are cruel and destructive. His betrayal of trust has shattered livelihoods and ruined honest businesses.</p>
                <p>We urge others to exercise extreme caution and not fall victim to his deceit.</p>
